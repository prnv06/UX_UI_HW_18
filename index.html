                I build intuitive products and services that seamlessly integrate with peopleâ€™s natural lifestyle patterns and habits.
                I have used my extensive experience in user research, ideation, prototyping and testing to help large retail brands save millions of dollars in shipping costs; to help travelers find the best travel deals; and to enable people to be more involved in their communites.
                I am based in New York City, but originally hail from Bangalore, India. I love to travel, run marathons and practice Muay Thai, and care deeply about environmental sustainability. 
                Thanks for stopping by!
